In a consumption-based civilization the purpose of all media is to stimulate consumption. This can come in the form of advertising, corporate propaganda, or the legitimization of the imperial power required to keep mines and long distance supply chains operating. In the age of digital media we find that the hardware itself is also a large component of how it facilitates consumption, with planned obsolescence creating a stream from mine to landfill unprecedented in human history. A constant race to build ever more exotic materials and technologies into physical media devices creates a vast suction across the planet, forcing every corner of the globe to exploit anything that can be mined for digital media hardware from cobalt to lithium to be exploited as fast and widely as possible.
