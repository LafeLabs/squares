Dig it up, set it on fire, and bury it. Our civilization is an ever-accelerating destructive flow of material from mine to landfill. This work is based on the idea that we can do better. Much better! We have dug such a vast array of useful minerals up in the last few hundred years and carried out such fantastic transformations on them into useful materials that we now have the opportunity to build a whole new civilization with a completely different structure than the one we presently inhabit.

Our current industrial system is a tripod resting on these three legs: money, mining and property. These ideas make up a philosophical framework for understanding and building our world which is failing at an ever-accelerating rate. In order to build a new civilization, we must study in detail the structure of the existing one.

Money as an idea is so integrated into our world view that it is very hard to even see what it is. At its philosophical core, the idea of money is that there is a property we call “value” which can be denoted by a number. This is considered so obviously true by defenders of the existing economic system that when challenged, they simply re-state repeatedly the basic ideas immediately assuming that any system not based on money is just the same set of ideas re-arranged. That is, people will argue that doing away with money will simply replace selling a things with a certain “value” denote by prices with trading things to which such a value can also be assigned, but just in a much more inconvenient way(barter). Similarly, the defenders of the idea of money will argue that “storing value” is an important task, again assuming that some kind of thing called “value” can be measured with numbers and that doing this all-important value storing will simply have to be done with vaults of metal if we dispense with money.
