# The Street Network
 
The trash magic network flows across the streets of the world. We use "streets" in the most general possible sense as spaces which are publicly accessible and which are used by people to get from place to place. This is all the streets, highways, paths, trails, rail lines, busses, bus stations, train stations, truck stops, rest stops, parks, shopping centers, parking lots, sidewalks and so on.
