# videos
 
Videos replicate the memes.  And they hook onto successful memes already in the network.  We can use duets on Tiktok and/or use sounds which are from smaller musicians who are on there trying to amplify their own music memes.  We go for memes which fit with what we are doing, going for a very DIY and maximalist aesthetic.  

And we replicate all the things in the set here.  Somehow we want to connect the virtual with the physical, to try to connect them together again and again.  Can we make a virtual version of the slimeZistor?  Can that be a thing that happens in software somehow?  What would that look like?  And free pants?  what are virtual pants?
