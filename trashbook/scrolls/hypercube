# The Geometron Hypercube
 
The "Geometron Hypercube" has a double meaning based on the philosophy of "as above, so below" as with all things in our system.

In the physical world of cardboard trash it is the set of all 4 inch cubes cut from SQUARES.    

In the virtual world it is a structure of geometric functions which are arranged in a pair of cubes.  One cube is for actions and one for symbols which represent those actions, which are themselves constructed using actions from the action cube.  

We say "hypercube" to represent the multiplicity of cubes, both in physical space and virtual space.  It is an extension into an infinite dimensional space of all the locations and nature of all the cubes, which we replicate and expand again and again infinitely.
