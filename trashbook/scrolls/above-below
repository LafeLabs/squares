# as above, so below

What does this mean? 

We use a flow of cardboard trash to create [cardboard squares](scrolls/cardboard).  We turn these into media which can represent anything. ANYTHING.  

We also take streams of computer waste and make servers which host virtual cardboard on which we create [virtual cardboard squares](scrolls/virtual) which can represent images of the physical ones.  

This is what we mean by "as above, so below".  While we borrow the phrase from alchemy and other occult practices, we take it to specifically mean the correspondence between the universe of all physical squares and the universe of all of their images in virtual cardboard.
