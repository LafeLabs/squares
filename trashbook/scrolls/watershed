# watershed
 
This is the original network of the living Earth and it is the network to which we aim to ultimately return with Trash Magic.  It is all the ways that water flows from sky to sea and back to sky.  Rivers, creeks, streams, canals, culverts, marshes, swamps, wetlands, aquifers, bays, gulfs, and all the other things connected to the water. 

Know your watershed. Define your reality by it.  Connect it to the others, and build the network.
